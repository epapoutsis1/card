What I learned

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Logo is based on my portfolio brand so I decided to use it for my business card by implementing animation.

What I'm most proud of

This was my first time using JavaScript. It pushed me out of my comfort zone to explore the different design elements like adding the animation to my logo. This transitioning to JavaScript was tough to navigate in the end, it was rewarding. The card is minimal for an easy to read brand strategy.
