What I learned

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used illustrator to render my wireframes desk and mobile. The Logo is based on my portfolio brand so I implemented zoom in down animation in JavaScript.

What I'm most proud of

This was my first time using JavaScript. It pushed me out of my comfort zone to explore the different design elements like adding the animation to my logo. Transitioning from CSS to JavaScript was tough making it a rewarding project.
